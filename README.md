# CollegeEssentials
CollegeEssentials is an app made to help all students get through the hard life of education. It was developed for our major project to finalize our 4th year of software development. Some of it's aspects where decided based on personal experience and the idea that we can help people dodge the same mistakes made constantly. Forgetting assignments, losing your timetable and getting lost in the new city. So with that the comes with 4 main sections:

1. Camera navigation thoughout your college. Pointing you in the right direction. ;)
2. Timetable section so that you can store your timetable once and only once.
3. Assignment countdown timers so that you never forget about that deadline again.
4. Google maps section to store your favourite places in town and you won't get lost in the new city. :)

Please see our video demo [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oNZN0csfSI&feature=youtu.be)

## Installation
The app is still currently under construction. It will be fully developed and working for Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology first because that is where we are based. It will then be updated to accomadate the other college's listed. At this point, the only way to install the app is to either fork this repo or download the zip file, both methods require the project to be opened in Android Studio and ran using the emulator or your personal android device. **Note** if your laptop/PC doesn't support hardware virtualization and you cannot install intels haxm software, using your own device is encouraged.

## Contributing
1. Fork it or download it!
2. Run it through Android Studio. It will be uploaded to the play store eventually.
3. Test and use the app.
4. If you find no problems skip this step :D
5. Create an issue on this github in the format of SECTION:PROBLEM and clearly identify the bug found and the android system you are using.

### Example.
Homescreen freezes on load up and the image does not display clearly. I am running this on my Galaxy S6 using Android lollipop.
